		- stats (health bar, score points, upgrade points)
		- customizing ship
		- advanced weapons (which are crafted or bought later)
		- bases (big space station, planet, big asteroid, system of space stations or something like that)
		- customizing placement components around ship (put weapons infront, shield, reflective shield, big but weaker shield, power, lot of other stuff ...)
		- more complex health (maybe make each component of the ship have its health, volatility, but keep overall health with some formula or averaging)
		- slow rotation
		- strafe movement (in case of additional engines available on sides)
		- when base is attacked add some info on minimap
